Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the cells of the breast. It
occurs when abnormal cells in the breast tissue begin to grow and divide
uncontrollably, forming a malignant tumor. Breast cancer can affect both women and
men, although it is much more common in women. Traditional classification use
morphology to divide tumors into separate categories with different behavior and
prognosis. However, there are limitations of traditional classification systems, and
new molecular methods are expected to improve classification systems. our website
dedicated to supporting doctors in the field of breast cancer. We provide valuable
resources and tools to aid medical professionals in their understanding and
management of this complex disease. In addition to conventional approaches, we
leverage the power of deep learning models to enhance diagnostic accuracy and
treatment planning. These models analyze vast amounts of data, enabling us to
extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions based on the
individualized characteristics of each patient's tumor. Our website offers a
comprehensive platform for doctors to access the latest research, clinical guidelines,
and innovative tools incorporating deep learning algorithms. By harnessing the
potential of these cutting-edge technologies, we aim to empower healthcare
professionals in their mission to provide the best possible care for breast cancer
patients. We already built a two successful models first model using CNN with
accuracy of 96% and second model using Random Forest with accuracy of 96%.
